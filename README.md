# ðŸ©º Medical Chatbot  

A **medical assistant chatbot** powered by **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **voice interaction** for natural, context-grounded conversations.  
The system is designed to provide reliable medical information retrieval from curated documents while supporting both **text** and **voice-based communication**.  


## ðŸ“Š System Pipeline  

![Pipeline Overview](static/images/pipeline.png)

1. **Knowledge Base**  
   Medical documents are embedded using `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` and stored in **Pinecone** for efficient semantic search.  

2. **User Interaction**  
   Users can submit queries via **keyboard input** or **speech**.  

3. **RAG with GPT-4o**  
   The chatbot uses a **RAG pipeline** to combine document retrieval with generative reasoning, ensuring accurate, grounded responses.  

4. **Response Delivery**  
   Answers are displayed in a **chat bubble UI** and can also be played back using **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** for a natural experience.  

5. **Data Persistence**  
   **MongoDB** stores user profiles and chat history for personalization and continuity.
